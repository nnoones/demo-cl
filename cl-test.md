#Test file from cl
File created with vim from the command line.

### To make it a little fancier, here's an H3 header.

#### I wonder if you can combine mardown, for instance use *markdown emphasis* on headers

Or embed different types of emphasis, for instance make *some italics **bold** like this*, or make **some bold *italic* instead**.
